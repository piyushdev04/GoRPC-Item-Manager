# RPC Item Management System

## This repository features a Go-based RPC item management system with a server for item operations (add, edit, delete, fetch) and a client for RPC interactions.

This project is a simple item management system built with Go using RPC (Remote Procedure Call). It has a server that lets you add, edit, delete, and fetch items, and a client that communicates with the server to perform these operations. It's open-source, so feel free to contribute and help improve it!

## Features
* Add new items to the database
* Edit existing items by title
* Delete items from the database
* Fetch all items in the database
* Fetch a specific item by its title

## Technologies Used
* Go (Golang) - for both server and client implementations
* RPC (Remote Procedure Call) - for communication between server and client

## Getting Started
* Clone the repository:
   ```bash 
   git clone https://github.com/piyushdev04/GoRPC-Item-Manager/tree/main.git

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find any bugs or want to improve the RPC item management system, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
